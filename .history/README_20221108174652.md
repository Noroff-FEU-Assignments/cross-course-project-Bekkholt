# Square Eyes

I have made a website for Square Eyes, a film buying site for streaming.

## Description

Square Eyes is a film buying site I made for the design CA. It is supposed to be a very simple and easy site with a clean look and a little cinema feeling.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I have used flexbox a lot, which requires a modern browser.

### See the site here

### See the site locally

- Clone project from git
- Open in VS Code
- Run with Live Share

## Known issues

There are still some small design details to fix here and there, but the other than that it should work just as it is supposed to.
