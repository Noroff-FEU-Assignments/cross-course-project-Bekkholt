    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are many practices to secure a website from attacks, these are just some of them. First, having https is better than http. This makes the data encrypted while going from the browser to the server. Then there are different tools to use, like CI/CD ones. These will run through your code and check for security holes and if it finds them, tell you to redo them. Do not put all your faith in the products and tools though. They help you, but you should also do other stuff to fully protect the website. You can sanitize data (to make sure the data is in the right format) and use authorization and authentication with third parties. Also, always be sure that this third-party is a trusted one to use. If you use an automatic timeout, this will also help prevent attacks against you. The timeout will make the user credentials expire after a while, so you must securely put it in again before being able to start another session. This will make it harder to attack and to do too much damage during that time period. Do include the whole business in the security practices, not only the security team themselves. The more people that are aware on what to do and what not to do, the better. Lastly, I will recommend doing some security exercises. To fake attacks to check whether your website can stand against it or not.</p>
