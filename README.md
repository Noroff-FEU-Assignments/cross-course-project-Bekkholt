# Square Eyes

I have made a website for Square Eyes, a film buying site for streaming.

## Description

Square Eyes is a film buying site I made for the design CA. It is supposed to be a very simple and easy site with a clean look and a little cinema feeling.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I have used flexbox a lot, which requires a modern browser.

## Further comments

I have done some small changes to my first prototype based on how it looked and felt when actually making it. At first I had the "back" button right next to the logo in the header, but it felt more right to have it on the right when scaling up from mobile. And I also put the picture on the About page to be centered after getting feedback from students.
Then I tried out to have the navigation bar in the header as well as recommended, but decided to put it back down in the footer after all. It did not look quite right and I think I would have to redesign a lot to actually make it work. I will definitely think about having it in the header instead when designing later though.
I am also aware of a couple of alerts that I got in the WAVE tools. As long as I have no errors I have decided to let the alerts be there to follow my design. This is why I have given the form inputs titles instead of labels. Just wanted to mention that I am fully aware of this, but figured this way would be the best one to meet both WCAG criterias and design.
