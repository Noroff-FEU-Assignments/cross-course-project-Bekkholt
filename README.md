I have made a website for Square Eyes, a film buying site for streaming. This is my first school project while studying front-end development.

## Description

Square Eyes is a film buying site I started making for the design CA. I continued working on it through my first school semester. It is supposed to be a very simple and easy site with a clean look and a little cinema feeling.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/cross-course-project-Bekkholt
```

### See the site locally

- Clone project from git
- Open in VS Code
- Run with Live Share

### Dependencies

I have used flexbox a lot, which requires a modern browser.
